# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

NimbusHomeCloud is a home cloud platform currently in early development. The repository contains only initial scaffolding — no build system, source code, or architecture has been established yet.

As development begins, update this file with:
- Build, lint, and test commands
- Technology stack and framework choices
- High-level architecture and component overview
- Key configuration and environment setup
